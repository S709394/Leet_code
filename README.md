A place that store some Leetcode questions ,solutions and ideas. (Most Java So far


## FAQ

### Q1:What is this?
     A place that stores some Leetcode practices.

### Q2: What kind of questions and solutions are stored here?
     1. The questions that I fully understand || able to follow.
     2. The questions that I have not fully followed. I left some comments on them to  show which part I do not get it so far and may get it soon  (No more than 5 I guess.)
     
### Q3: What kind of questions and solutions are NOT going to be stored here?
     1. The solutions that confuse me after I read them.
     2. The questions that I can not get it so far, I store them somewhere else. (Maybe bring them back after I solve them.)
     
### Q4: How do you name the classes?
     1.  "practise"  means I try to practise my own after I understand the solution myself.
     2.  Something like `leetcode_008_try2_build-In` ,  `leetcode_123_try3_stack`  
          means  "I used build-In method to make it short","I used the Stack to store treeNodes"
     
### Q5: Why so many comments in it? What are they for?
     0. The long comments are the way how I study.
     1. I store solutions infos (runtimes, complexity,etc）
     2. Some comments to reminds me:
       "what's happening  here " OR 
       "what I should remember after days or months. "  OR 
       "Hey , you do sth stupid here,make sure you take a look in these few lines."
       
### Q xxx    （May add sth later ）
